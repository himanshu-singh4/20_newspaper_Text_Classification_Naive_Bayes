# 20_newspaper_Text_Classification_Naive_Bayes

In this project, we manually implement the Naive Bayes algorithm to predict the newspaper from it's text content.
The dataset used is 20 newsgroup dataset with 19997 files. The accuracy we are getting by manual Naive Bayes is 85.26% and accuracy using sklearn's Multinomial Naive Bayes is 85.38%.
